## GIS in R

This page provides the codes and slides for the workshop GIS in R. The
workshop introduces the fundamentals of conducting spatial analysis
using R. We will explore the applications of spatial analysis in the
transport field to gain a clearer understanding of its practical use.
The session will then cover key techniques, including basic GIS concepts
and scripting for spatial analysis in R. Finally, the workshop will
introduce a package that connects to TDX transport data, providing a
useful toolkit for future projects and applications.

## Support

This workshop is offered as part of the **Public Transport** course in
the Department of Transportation and Logistics Management at National
Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.
